"""
Client-side script to gather quota information stored for the user on various filesystems and
display it in an understandable format.

Storing the quota information in a cache file accessible only to the user is taking too long
and will take even longer in the future. This approach is no longer used. Users should consult
the account page for cache quota information (with an accuracy of 10 minutes).
